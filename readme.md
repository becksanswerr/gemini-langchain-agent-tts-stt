## üåü Core Features

- **Conversational AI:** Powered by Google's Gemini Pro for natural and intelligent dialogue.
- **Interactive Web UI:** A fluid and responsive chat interface built with Streamlit.
- **Real-time Text-to-Speech:** Brings the agent to life using the `RealtimeTTS` library with the Coqui engine.
- **Modular Tool-Using Agent:** Uses LangGraph to decide which tool to use based on the user‚Äôs query.
- **Persistent Memory:** Saves conversations to MongoDB Atlas and displays them via an admin panel.
- **Specialized Knowledge:** Custom API tools for domain-specific tasks (e.g., The Land of Legends events).
- **General Knowledge:** Web search via Tavily for up-to-date, real-world information.
- **Expert Persona:** Guided by a system prompt to stay within its domain of expertise.
